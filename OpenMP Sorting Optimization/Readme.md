## **A program that implements sorting of a one-dimensional array by different algorithms (in a sequential and parallel implementation):**
### • Bubble (sequential implementation only)
### • Odd-odd permutation
### • Shell
### • Quick sorting (qsort)
For each implementation of the array sorting functions, perform a time calculation and form a pivot table. In this case, sorting is performed on the same data set, i.e. the original values of the array are copied into the array intended for sorting.
